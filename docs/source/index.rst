Welcome to mdakit-sasa's documentation!
=========================================================

This MDAKit module facilitates the calculation of Solvant Accessible Surface Area (SASA) using MDAnaysis.

.. note::
   The underline calculation and algorithm implementation is based on Freesasa, by Simon Mitternacht (2016) FreeSASA: An open source C library for solvent accessible surface area calculation. F1000Research 5:189 (doi: 10.12688/f1000research.7931.1)



This kit is a standalone package that utilizes MDAnalysis components to addresss the specific calculation of the solvant accessible area during a molecular dynamics simulatio.
